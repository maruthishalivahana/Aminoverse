# 🧬 AminoVerse – Protein & Gene Function Generator

[🌐 Live Demo](https://brilliant-granita-c96f3b.netlify.app/)

**AminoVerse** is a React-based web application that generates detailed biological functions for human proteins or genes. Users can input a protein or gene name, and the app fetches and displays relevant insights including molecular functions, biological processes, and cellular components. The platform offers an interactive and intuitive UI, client-side routing, real-time data fetching, and authentication. AminoVerse aims to make complex bioinformatics data accessible in a user-friendly way.
