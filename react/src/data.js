    "description": "The p53 protein is a tumor suppressor that plays a crucial role in regulating the cell cycle and preventing cancer formation. It is often referred to as the 'guardian of the genome' due to its role in maintaining genomic stability. Mutations in the TP53 gene, which encodes the p53 protein, are commonly found in various types of cancers, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and tumor development.",
